# Red_Sand
Unity remake of an older GameMaker game I previously made.

The original game can be played here: https://lake-inn-games.itch.io/red-sand
This is an attempt to remake the game in 3d, in order to practice working in 3d.
I need to learn more about hitboxes and best practices in using them in order to continue the project.
